### Creating a unique style

In order to help differentiate CurrencyFair and make them stand out, I proposed to the wider team a project to create tailor-made illustrations to help explain concepts and improve branding throughout the website and web app. My aim was to create an illustration style that was unique to CurrencyFair and helped to reflect the personality of the brand; modern and helpful. To do this, I began experimenting with different styles and settled on an outlined style with trimmed lines and using the brand gradient as the main colour. This helped to bring colour throughout the website and web app, and add personality to transactional screens.

### Complex versus simple

One of the key issues when working with illustrations is size restrictions. Detailed illustrations can not be scaled down to small containers, otherwise you risk losing the detail which sets them apart. On the other hand, simple illustrations are built as their name suggests; simple. They should not be scaled up to fit larger containers, rather they should be kept small to avoid making them feel disproportionate and hide that they lack in detail. As a result, I had to create two versions of illustrations; complex and simple. The complex illustrations were used to bring life to a screen or used in email headers whereas simple illustrations were confined to smaller areas such as icons. This differentiation allowed the product designers more freedom to use certain illustrations throughout their designs, without compromising on quality. With the redesign of the CurrencyFair brochure site (you can see that here), the illustrations were removed in favour of more images of our product to help build trust in potential customers. However, the illustrations can still be seen throughout the mobile app and web app where they help to give some life and colour.
