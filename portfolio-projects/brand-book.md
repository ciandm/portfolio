### Refreshing the brand and improving consistency

Working in collaboration with the brand manager of CurrencyFair in 2019, I began work on **refreshing the look and feel of CurrencyFair**. The previous brand book was a couple of years old and did not reflect the recent work that was being completed, so an updated brand book was the obvious next step. This project was carried out to ensure the business had a **consistent and cohesive look** and feel as we entered new markets, with visibility for all employees of CurrencyFair. We were able to deliver an extensive document with over **40 pages** that could explain who CurrencyFair was, what it was doing, and how they did it. These included guidelines ranging from the use of our logo to imagery best practices and misuses as well as colours and typography.

### Applying my take on the brand

As the project co-lead and only in-house designer for the marketing team, it fell on me to fully flesh out the CurrencyFair brand guidelines which allowed me to put my stamp on the brand moving forward. Collaborating with relevant stakeholders - from content writers to the head of marketing, I was able to gain **valuable input from people around the business which I was able to present in a comprehensive and engaging document**. I enjoy getting feedback from all relevant parties when engaging in a design project, so having the opportunity to engage with others and get their views on the brand was something I looked forward to.

As a global and well-established business, I did choose to opt for a **softer approach and chose to refresh the brand rather than a rebrand**. This included selecting and refining an updated palette of colours to work with which would be incorporated into every marketing asset. The document contained **multiple pages of potential executions** on how creatives could and should be designed. I wanted the brand book to be more than simply colour, typography, and image choices, instead, I wanted it to be a strong starting point that any other designer, or interested party, could read and immediately be able to **immerse themselves in CurrencyFair's brand**.

### Consistency is key

Perhaps one of the biggest issues I encountered at CurrencyFair after joining was the lack of consistency across creatives, which meant it was **harder for consumers to associate themselves with the brand**. In a business that was expanding globally and entering multiple new markets, branding and messaging had to be consistent across the board. With the extensive brand book developed I was able to help the team align across multiple areas such as tone of voice, imagery and colour usage. Creatives became much more consistent, with easy access to assets and references available for outsourced designers to assist them in helping deliver campaigns much faster and with more success.
