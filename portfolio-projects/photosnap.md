  "Using designs from www.frontendmentor.io to build a website for a fictional landing page, for a platform called Photosnap, which makes it easy to share for photographers to share their photos and connect with others. It included the strong use of imagery throughout, with a full-width design implemented that really helps showcase images.",
  "Please note - as this is a fictional website some links on the live site are intentionally left unfinished. This would obviously not be the case if it was a real site."
