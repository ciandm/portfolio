This included updating the look and feel of CurrencyFair Business as a brand, and implementing it across the brochure site and creatives."

### A sleeker, more professional look

The branding for the personal side of CurrencyFair typically used lighter and fun colours, which didnâ€™t translate across to the offering we wanted to attract potential businesses with. As a payments platform, CurrencyFair needed its business brand to appear more professional and appeal to businesses. Over a two week sprint, I solely focussed on fleshing out our business brand which included an in-depth discovery of potential colours that would separate the business brand from the personal brand. In the end, I opted for a more executive feel, with darker colours and a golden accent for a more premium experience. The differentiation between both personal and business became much clearer and after many feedback sessions with relevant stakeholders, I was ready to begin implementing the look and feel of the new business brand.

### First point of contact - the brochure site
Moving towards a focus on businesses inevitably meant that our business offering would have to be compelling and one of the first projects that I was able to apply my new ideas for the business brand was on the CurrencyFair brochure site. Working closely with the content and product team, I was responsible for designing multiple pages which ranged from the business home page,  unique features available to businesses and use case pages. With knowledge of building components and pages with React, I was able to work closely with the developer on this project and ensure that my designs were consistent and made use of the strength of reusable components. Due to time constraints and deadlines, I was keen to work out any issues that arose during development and tweak designs if needed. After just over a month of design, feedback and development we were able to release almost ten pages which allowed the business to fully begin its transition to a focus on B2B offerings.

### Product is king
One of my main goals for the redesign of the CurrencyFair Business site was to feature more images and graphics of our product. Trust is a major factor when signing up to send high volumes of money to a company, and showcasing the product is a great way of alleviating some fears for potential customers before they make a purchase decision. Throughout the CurrencyFair Business brochure site, I utilised multiple different formats to display the product. These included videos, animated SVGs using Lottie and large screenshots. Immediately, customers were able to get an insight into how the product looks before creating an account. Animations and videos helped to explain content while more detailed screenshots of the product were used to explain and introduce features. As a result, potential customers have a much clearer picture of the offerings that CurrencyFair Business has as well as how they can offer it through their product.

### The result
The main goal of the business during this period was to position themselves more towards business payments rather than personal money transfers. With the redesign and rebrand I delivered, CurrencyFair had a much stronger position to move forwards with. Features for businesses became much clearer to see while animations and product shots helped potential customers to get a sense of what the product looked like before signing up. As a result, the business offering was far stronger and the brochure site was more streamlined, focusing on features and reviews, which led to a higher number of visitors proceeding to sign up. In fact - in a year on year comparison of visitors who proceeded to step one of registration after visiting the business brochure site it was found that the total number had doubled from 9.53% to 18.92% which was a resounding success.
