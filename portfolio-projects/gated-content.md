### Thought leaders need leading designs

As CurrencyFair Business began to implement HubSpot which allowed for better lead capturing, compelling content in the form of e-books and e-guides were created by the talented content team that required strong designs to match the material inside. I was tasked with translating the content across to engaging and visual documents that would reflect CurrencyFairâ€™s position as a thought leader in the business space. Utilizing the strength of collaboration within Figma, I was able to design whilst constantly having the relevant stakeholders provide feedback through comments or Zoom sessions. This excellent teamwork helped to deliver high-quality documents and address concerns, design or content, on the fly which helped us to speed up the process from design to delivery.

### A limited team needs to work productively

With a small team and tight deadlines to deliver on campaign pipelines, it fell on me to create these content offers as efficiently as possible. Not only did we have ongoing feedback sessions during the design phase, but I also developed a style guide and template for creating the documents which enabled us to move faster on designing out multiple pages without worrying about minute things such as typography, colours and layouts. With these guidelines in place, I was able to begin laying out content at a rapid pace whilst still maintaining consistency across multiple separate documents. There was gradually less and less feedback in terms of the design of the documents, and the team could focus instead on going through the document with a fine comb and correcting any grammatical issues as well as rearranging content which resulted in the content offers being delivered ahead of schedule on multiple occasions. 

### Delivering the content

When the work was completed, it needed to be accessible to potential interested readers. Using the power of HubSpot and lead generation, I was tasked with designing and developing landing pages where visitors could learn more about the document and download the PDF. One of the strengths with HubSpot is their drag and drop landing page builder which I was able to utilize by building reusable separate components with HTML, CSS and HubL (HubSpots own templating language) which the content creators could create unique pages from. As well, I created ads for social media to grab attention and direct readers to the landing page. This allowed me to control the look and feel of the whole journey from seeing the content on their social media platform, to downloading the content through a form submission all the way to consuming it.
