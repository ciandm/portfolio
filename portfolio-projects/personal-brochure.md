### Revamping the brochure site, with scalability in mind

As CurrencyFair began to enter new markets, the old brochure site began to appear dated and required revitalisation so it could translate across to more international markets. As the business began to migrate away from WordPress towards Gatsby and React, there was no better time to implement improved designs. I was also able to implement a refreshed feel of the CurrencyFair personal brand, which helped to differentiate it more from the branding for CurrencyFair Business. As a result, there is now a much clearer distinction between the personal and business products that CurrencyFair has to offer. After countless Figma comments and feedback sessions, I was able to design a completely revamped brochure site for CurrencyFair with a large emphasis on showing the product using animations and app screenshots. This included the delivery of over 10 brand new pages, each with well thought out flows to maximise exposure to the product before customers have even registered.

### Getting the most out of a small team

Working in such a small team with such tight deadlines, I had to ensure what I was designing was not only excellent in design but also efficient in being implemented. With a couple of content writers, a product owner and a single developer on the project, I had to ensure the designs were easy to implement as this was the biggest potential blocker. To achieve this, I provided clear instructions to the developer with annotated designs explaining exactly what I was looking for, which enabled him to develop without any guesswork. As well, when feedback was required, I went through his implementations and created Figma documents with clear screenshots of where changes were required and what those changes were - from padding or margin issues to font sizes. This helped to speed up our process of revising the live pages, as he had a clear visual of what design changes I was requesting. Reusing components was also one of the fastest ways we could build the new pages. These components were designed and built correctly the first time, with variations such as light and dark versions, which meant when designing pages I could simply reuse components whenever possible to help speed up the process. This also gave us a bonus of consistency across a suite of pages.

### Bringing the site to life

As a modern fintech brand, I wanted to add interactivity and movement throughout the new brochure site. One of the ways to achieve this was including animations that ranged from icons to animations of our product which helped visitors to better visualise the product and aid in explaining the content. One of the main goals of these new pages was to highlight how easy it is to sign up to CurrencyFair and begin sending money. I achieved this by designing an interactive carousel of four simple steps which walked through each step on a timer and displayed the corresponding image on the CurrencyFair app. This helped us to showcase our product whilst at the same time showing how easy the product in a unique fashion. These small elements of interactivity and movement throughout the pages helped to elevate the designs and help bring a rejuvenated and contemporary feel to the brand.
