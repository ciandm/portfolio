### Testing before implementing

With something as important as a registration page, **I had to be sure what I was designing was as clear as possible** for the user so it would not have a negative impact on potential conversions. One of the key issues with the original sign up page was that it was unclear which account a user was signing up for; a personal account or a business account. As a result, extra workload was added to the customer experience and product team to deal with the issues that arose from this and manually change the accounts to a business account.

One of the main goals for this project was to make this difference much clearer, and to do this I had to test multiple variations of designs on Usability Hub. The question here to the testers was simple - **“Imagine you’re a business owner intending to open an account with CurrencyFair - where would you click next?”**. Over multiple tests with random users selected from around the world, I was able to refine my design for the registration page until I achieved a **100% click rate** on the toggle for creating a business account, something that fell short on the original design with around 60% success rate. With these excellent results, I had the confidence to move forward with the chosen design and fully deliver a new and improved registration page.

### Highlighting the different accounts

With two separate accounts on offer, with unique benefits for each, I wanted to **clearly differentiate the two accounts** in a way that could show these benefits before signing up as one final push to encourage the registration. To do this, I chose to implement a sidebar on the registration page that would change depending on which account the user chose and display the benefits for each of the accounts. This gave the added benefit of highlighting the branding difference between choosing a CurrencyFair personal or business account. One of the reasons I chose to do this was so potential customers could associate themselves with the account they were choosing. For example, if a business customer was to leave the sign up page and return at a later date on the personal flow the branding may look different and could prompt them to select the correct account which again ties in to one of the original goals; making the difference between choosing a personal and business account much clearer.
